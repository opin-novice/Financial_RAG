(iv) the adjusted :price under sub-clause. (iti) is. taken
to be the arm's length ‘price :of the property
transferred or services ‘rendered in, the

(b) resale price method is applied in the following
manner: — ; ;

(i) the price at-which the said property or service is
resold to an independent enterprise:is identified;

(1) the price, as identified in sub-clause (i), is
reduced by a: comparable normal. gross margin;

(iii) the price so arrived at is: then adjusted for other.
unique costs (such, as customs duty) associated
with the purchase of the property or services;

(iv) the price so. arrived at is then adjusted to take
into account the material differences (differences
that could materially affect: the gross margin in
open, market: condition) such. as functions
performed, risks involved, assets employed, time
gap between. the original. purchase and the resale.
and ‘accounting practices between ‘the
international transactions and the comparable
uncontrolled transactions, or between the
enterprises undertaking such transactions;

taken to be the arm's length price of the property
purchased or the service obtained in the
international transaction.
