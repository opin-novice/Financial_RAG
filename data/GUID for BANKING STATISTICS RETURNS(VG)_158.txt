Interest Rate Spread Chapter 12
CHAPTER 12: INTEREST RATE SPREAD
12.1 INTRODUCTION:
The Statistics Department of, Bangladesh Bank has been, collecting detailed’ interest rate wise
information on. deposits and advances from all scheduled banks:since August 2008 and from
all non-banks. ‘financial institutes (NBFI’s) since January, 2013 operating in ‘Bangladesh’ in the
prescribed formats on monthly basis. On-the basis of ‘these returns ‘the weighted’ average rates
on deposits ‘and advances ‘aré calculated. for compilation. of Interest.Rate Spread (IRS)..
Interest Rate Spread (IRS) is an important determinant of the productivity of the banking
system! in a.country. Magnitude of the spread varies across: the. world. It is actually reverse to’
the degree of efficiency of: the 'banking sector, which is an offshoot of a competitive
environment. The nature and efficiency. of the ‘financial sector have'been ‘found to, be the major
reasons behind! differences in. IRS in.countries across: the world: In economies with. weak.
financial! sectors, ithe intermediation. costs which are ‘involved in deposits mobilisation and.
channelling them into: productive uses, as much larger. They have been found to be responsible
for high spreads.
12.2 DEFINITION.
The gap between the interest rate a financial institute: pays on deposits. and the higher rate: it
charges for loans. i:e., the difference between Weighted, Average Lending Rates and. Weighted,
Average Deposit Rates.
12.3-CALCULATION PROCEDURE OF INTEREST RATE: SPREAD.
Earlier, Bangladesh Bank developed: a‘uniform format for.calculation of the interest. rate spread.
considering: regional and international practices which iis weighted average method. In this
method spread ‘between lending and déposit rates would be calculated as the difference.
between ‘weighted: average interest rates ‘on. advances: and weighted average interest. rates ‘on
deposits. Weights for each type.of advance ‘and deposit would. be calculated! using end-period.
outstanding amount.
