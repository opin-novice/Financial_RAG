- Provides more comprehensive document retrieval
- Better coverage of relevant information

### 2. Cross-Encoder Re-ranking
- Uses BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3 for document re-ranking
- Filters out irrelevant documents more effectively
- Improves context quality for response generation

### 3. Language Detection
- Automatic Bengali/English language detection
- Language-specific prompt templates
- Better handling of multilingual queries

### 4. Quality Filtering
- Form field and template filtering
- Relevance threshold filtering
- Better document preparation

## Sample Question Analysis

- **Advanced RAG**: 0.4900 similarity
- **Vanilla RAG**: 0.4185 similarity
- **Improvement**: +17.1%

### Question 2: "‡¶≠‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßÅ ‡¶Ö‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶°‡ßá‡¶° ‡¶ü‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∏ ‡¶è‡¶¨‡¶Ç ‡¶∏‡¶Æ‡ßç‡¶™‡ßÇ‡¶∞‡¶ï ‡¶∂‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡ßç‡¶ï ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶ß‡¶ø‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶≤‡¶æ, ‡ß®‡ß¶‡ßß‡ß¨-‡¶è‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡¶Ç‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶ø‡¶™‡ßç‡¶§ ‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶Æ ‡¶ï‡ßÄ?"
- **Advanced RAG**: 0.8092 similarity
- **Vanilla RAG**: 0.3529 similarity
- **Improvement**: +129.4%

### Question 3: "‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßã‡¶™‡¶ø‡¶§ ‡¶≤‡¶≠‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶∂" ‡¶ï‡¶ø?
- **Advanced RAG**: 0.8306 similarity
- **Vanilla RAG**: 0.2918 similarity
- **Improvement**: +184.6%

## Conclusion

The evaluation clearly demonstrates that the Advanced RAG system significantly outperforms the Vanilla RAG system across all metrics:

1. **39.85% improvement** in mean cosine similarity
2. **Better consistency** with lower standard deviation
3. **Higher minimum scores** indicating better handling of difficult questions
4. **More reliable performance** across different types of queries

The Advanced RAG system's sophisticated architecture, including RRF fusion retrieval, cross-encoder re-ranking, and quality filtering, provides substantial improvements in response quality and consistency for Bengali financial question answering.

## Recommendations

1. **Deploy Advanced RAG** for production use due to superior performance
2. **Monitor performance** on larger datasets to validate these results
3. **Consider fine-tuning** the cross-encoder threshold for specific use cases
4. **Expand evaluation** to include more diverse question types and languages
